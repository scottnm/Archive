Restructure "db" idea so that each entry is it's own file. Then have a separate index file that's just a simple hashmap
to load different files and whatnot.

Or use bolt db

or just encode a hashmap (since shit is flattened does that mean that I need a separate id->post hashtable and then an
        json/hashmap deal to describe different properties and whatnot)


update to the feed items

need... 
    "feed id" (readable)
    "item state" (readwritable)

Today:....
    
    Filtering and sorting given in data buffer
