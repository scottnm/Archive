Welcome!

This is an overview of the key features of the C programming language and how it differs from languages that students may be more familiar with like Java. As well, I will also provide a simple walkthrough of how to compile, run, and debug simple C programs.

This overview will be structured as a series of files with comments for notes. Follow the files in the number they are ordered.

This is **NOT** intended to be an exhaustive resource for students to fully understand exactly everything that is happening in C. You will learn a lof of that stuff in your CS 429 class.

That being said if you have any questions, feel free to post them as issues or email me directly :)
