To compile a C program on a Unix like operating system (Mac or Linux)
    use the following command in the terminal:

gcc <your source c files> -o <name of your output file>

e.g: gcc main.c helper.c -o my_program


There is also a pretty great tool called "Make" to help with C compilation.
The basic gist of it is that you write makefiles which give you shortcuts or targets 
for how you want to compile a set of source files

to use make...
1. create a file called makefile
2. write all of your compilation targets in this makefile
3. use the make <target> command to run that target compilation
