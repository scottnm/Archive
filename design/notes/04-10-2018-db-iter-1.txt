How should this database idea work?

* each feed stores the serialized version of new feedreaderitems
* each feedreader updates special feed specific metadata


full spec overview reminder:

1. simple database that supports pagination
* "to read" page shows latest 5 feed items from every feed (special button to filter which feeds you see possibly)
* "saved" page for feed items that I think are worthy of storing for later
* "read" page for feed items that I'm done reading. The read part of the database is pruned every so often to prevent backup

Steps toward making this work...

1. Write a feed item serializing interface and stub impl (work on twitter impl later)
2. Serialize feed items and store them in a file
3. On load read the feed items and display previously read feed items
