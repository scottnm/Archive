# ScottNM Archive

This repository contains old code which I've decided to archive.

This decision to archive usually represents that the code is abandoned and likely pretty terrible or entirely useless.

Nevertheless, I'm hopelessly sentimental. Sometimes I look at old code like it's my middle school year book -- with equal parts wistful glee and horror.

## Projects

| ♥ | Project | Description | Rough Date |
|---|---------|-------------|------------|
| ♥ | Rust FFI Demo | At work I've written a few SDKs for multiplayer game scenarios and each SDK has had a C++ or C interface with a C ABI. At one point, I wondered what it would look like to expose a rust interface for one of these libraries. This project was an exploration of that using a stub API. I haven't done anything useful with it, but I did mostly complete the exploratory exercise. | 2020 |
|   | rssserver | I got pretty excited about golang and rssfeeds for awhile. I planned out a pretty fun project to write an RSS client for myself using golang and then somewhere I lost interest. This project is mostly worth archiving just because it's interesting to see how much I planned (and how little code I wrote). | 2018 |
|   | TimeJournal | Abandoned project where I intended to build a program that pesters me with a text editor every 10 minutes to track how I'm spending my time throughout the day. I got far enough to setup a recurring threadpool timer to launch a text editor but couldn't figure out how to do some of the more interesting pieces like sending an email or handling unreliable PC power states. Oh well. Inspired by Mike Acton's [12 tips for making better use of your time.](https://sites.google.com/site/macton/home/gamedev12tipsformakingthebestuseofyourtime) | 2017 |
|   | scott_chat | This was another learning project where I just wanted an excuse to write a simple WinSock socket app. When I wrote this I was sitting around twiddling my thumbs about to join a team of OS networking engineers and I was feeling unprepared. I don't know that this really helped by it gave my twiddly thumbs something to do. | 2017 |
|   | snm_json | I think at one point I was trying to write a json parser in C? then at some point I switched to C++ because I was coward who didn't want to implement my own hashmap. I remember the JSON parser mostly worked and this was mostly a learning project anyway to refresh my C/C++ memory. | 2017 |
|   | Blastbeat | At one point, I started following the Handmade Hero project. I marathoned the first 8 days and built some trippy demo window but stopped short of following the other 400+ days of streams. | 2017 |
| ♥ | C-Lang-Overview | Back in school, I wrote a "C Language" primer course for incoming freshman who were about to take their first Computer Architecture course and who did not have any experience with systems programming. Many years later and I haven't double checked to see if I've explained everything super correctly, but I remember putting a lot of effort into this to help my peers and I'm proud of that. | 2016 |
|   | Twodthreed | I don't remember what this project was after. I think I wanted to generate 3 models from a simpler 2D format to help with whiteboxing 3D game levels. Probably not a great use of my time. Better tools already exist. | 2016 |
|   | GitTreeTrack | This was supposed to help me with some git tree visualization. Several years later, I realize trying visualize git this way was really just a misuse of git. I don't remember how far I got with this project. | 2016 |
| ♥ | TextMusic | A hackathon project. We wanted to see if we could build a transformer which takes a string of text and generates music from it. The idea was that languages are (in some part) meant to be heard so there might be some naturally interesting properties that could be turned into music. We didn't get far enough to make anything that sounds nice but it certainly generates some funny sounds. | 2015 |
| | PollApp | An exploratory angularJS project | 2015 |
| | Quick Radio | Builds radio-like playlists from seed artists using the Spotify and Echonest Apis. This was my first exposure to using a REST API and is one of the first projects that felt like something that could *almost* be useful. It of course wasn't but I was pretty proud of this at the time. I don't think it works anymore. | 2015 |
| | Yasogami Quiz | I was a part of an internet community that set out to learn javascript together. For our first community project, we were supposed to create a quiz application that tallied a users answers and provided a score at the end. I built one in the style of those "What character are you?" quizzes based on the game *Persona 4*. | 2015 |
| | Space-Raiders | text-based Space Invaders clone built using ncurses. I believe I built this for an intro to C++ class. | 2015 |
| | itchnscratch | I think I made this little top-down shooter pygame prototype over a winter break from school. It was a blast. I remember laying on the floor for hours at a time working on it and listening to Game Grumps christmas episodes. I wrote it on a 2011 11" MacBook Air that I bought from someone in Austin for like $200. That machine served me really well throughout all of college. I miss it. | 2014 |
| ♥ | EvolvingBossBattles | This project was part of a "freshman research initiative" back in school intended to get freshman exposure to academic research disciplines. This project was all about neural nets and video games. It was a fun experience. | 2014 |
| | BinaryTreeBuilder | I *think* this is something I wrote for a competitve coding contest at school. I remember being proud of this at the time. | 2014 |
| | Avoid | A friend and I were going to make an android phone game for a Hackathon. We didn't get very far. | 2014 |
| | Neuroevolution-Pong | A neural net to play pong | 2014 |
| | Neural-Network-NAND | A neural net to represent a 3-bit NAND | 2014 |
