# snm_json

A toy json parser

I don't 100% remember my motivations or original intentions, but I believe I started this project as a playground to practice my C chops and manual memory management.

At some point, I dropped flat C for C++ because I was lazy and didn't want to write my own hashmap. C'est la vie.

I certainly don't plan on returning to this anytime soon, but in 2021 I was feeling nostalgic and browsing old github repos and I ran across this. Thought I'd try and justify its existence.
