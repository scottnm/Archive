Assignment:

You are going to write a simple linked list in C.

All of the boilerplate test code has been written and can be found in main.c

All of the functions you should implement are in linked_list.h

You should write a linked_list.c file and place all of your implementation in there

You will know you've passed this simple test and completed the assignment and get
    the success message.

You can compile and run the assignment by using "make linked_list" in the terminal
    and then running "./linked_list"

Issues:

If you get a segfault that means you are probably trying to dereference a null pointer somewhere.
To fix this here are some debugging strategies:
    Double check your code for obvious mistakes (forgetting to initalize data for instance)...
    Inspect your linked list using printf...
    run "make linked_list_debug" and then use GDB (the C debugger) to step through your code
