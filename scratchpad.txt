AMMO IDEA
	survival horror-esque semi-full clips
	PARTIAL RELOAD OR NO PARTIAL RELOAD?!?! something to think about
ENVIRONMENT IDEA
	destructible environments
AIMING IDEA
	-shaky/random aiming. the longer you hold still the better your aim gets
	-constantly turning results in low accuracy
	-pick random position inside of some MAX angle and fire at that rotation instead of character's actual rotation

	-implement 'aim down sights' effectively hold a key to prevent rotation so accuracy increases
WEAPON IDEA
	bow and arrow with retrievable ammo (arrow used to kill zombie can be picked up occassionally and sometimes they break)

ENEMY IDEA
	implement zombie wobble
	implement hit stun when player collides with zombo

PLAYER IDEA
	implement stamina

QUICK NOTES
DONE - generate more than 5 enemies
- limit / control ammo generation in some way

- the greater the bullet's velocity is, the smaller the loss in precision is therefore the bullet flies straighter. Perhaps increase bullet's velocity and implement someway of detecting collisions between bullets and enemies when bullets could skip over enemies with a large velocity
