AMMO IDEA
	survival horror-esque semi-full clips
	PARTIAL RELOAD OR NO PARTIAL RELOAD?!?! something to think about
ENVIRONMENT IDEA
	destructible environments
AIMING IDEA
	-shaky/random aiming. the longer you hold still the better your aim gets
	-constantly turning results in low accuracy
	-pick random position inside of some MAX angle and fire at that rotation instead of character's actual rotation

WEAPON IDEA
	bow and arrow with retrievable ammo (arrow used to kill zombie can be picked up occassionally and sometimes they break)
