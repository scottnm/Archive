Your practice assignment:

Implement a singly linked list in C

You should be able to..

* add to this linked list at the front back or some index
* remove from the front, back, or some index of the linked list
* print the linked list

Here's a hint to get you started...

Your node struct should look something like this...

struct node
{
    int val;
    struct node* next;
}
